Foogle Play Single Page Application (Backbone.js)
==========================================================================

This is a very small and super simple project that was developed for my course "Foundations of Front-End Development" [here](http://train.codingshack.com),
to teach students how to build a Single Page Application with Backbone.js.

No build tools, nor automation or optmiziations are present, being a simple project aiming at illustrating how a Backbone application is developed from concept to finish, dealing with view lifecycle management, routing and Unit Testing.

### Technologies Used ###

- Backbone.js (1.1.2)
- Mocha + Chai for BDD Unit testing

### No Browserify ? or Backbone Modules ? where's Grunt ? ###

This application was developed for an introductory course on Front-End Development. At the end of the course the student needs to be able to fully grasp the technologies used. Hence this project focuses on getting things done using the basic, essential tools for a student aspiring to become a Junior Front-End Developer: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Backbone.js, Responsive Design and BDD Unit Testing with Mocha+Chai.
